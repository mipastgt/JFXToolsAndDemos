== Missing features for Gluon/GraalVM/native-image toolchain

=== Missing support for more than one locale
* https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/2908

=== Media
* No media support on some platforms

=== NSMenuFX
* The platform menu bar isn't supported yet. (VERIFY)
* The new version has problems with the JNA library.

=== Configuration too complicated and error prone
* Integrate native image agent into workflow.
  Seems to work perfectly well!
  (Does it conflict with the default config options?)

=== Native images far too big to be useful
* UPX to the rescue
* This could be a unique selling point for JavaFX, compared to other competing technologies such as Electron.

=== No option to create a proper application bundle
* Seems to be easy on macOS. It's just a tiny wrapper plus one icon.

=== No option to create a platform installer bundle
* Should be easy to do with jpackage. (VERIFY)
